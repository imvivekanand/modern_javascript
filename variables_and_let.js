//Variables are like "labeled jars" for a value in JavaScript.
//We can store a value and give it a name, so that we can: recall it, use it, or change it later.
let someName = "value";
//Examples:
let age = 26;

let lemons = 4;
let orange = 6;
lemons = lemons - 1;
console.log(lemons + orange)
//We cannot name a variable with keywords, objects, document, number at start.
//Use meaningfull name, camelCase
//Cannot make a new variable with the same name.
